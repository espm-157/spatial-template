# Exercise 
This module is inspired by a recent paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, [**Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9). The authors 
used multiple constraints including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth
and more, to limit and map areas suitable for aquaculture.

We are going to use a similar, but much more simplified approach here. 
We will map potential areas of marine aquaculture for the super cute Pacific spiny lumpsucker (*Eumicrotremus orbis*)

![They have adhesive pelvic disks! How cute!](./images/lumpsucker.png)

To do this we are going to need the following spatial data:  

**1. Sea Surface Temperature** (raster data)  
**2. Net Primary Productivity** (raster data)  
**3. Marine Protected Areas**  (vector data)  

```{r libraries, include= FALSE}

devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2") #installing the developer version of ggplot for the geom_sf() function

library(mapview)      #interactive maps, raster + vector layers
library(raster)       #Main raster library
library(tidyverse)    #our old friend
library(sf)           #to work with simple features data

```  

## Exercise 1: Play with Vector Data

So to figure out where we might find the lumpsucker fish, we need to know a little
about it!

From [NOAA's species description](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish68a.html):

> A lot of people who see Pacific spiny lumpsuckers for the first time describe them as a ping-pong ball with fins. They are tiny and very inefficient swimmers, found most often in kelp or eelgrass beds attached to a rock or a log no deeper than 500 feet. They are quite common, ranging from the waters off the Washington coast, up around the arc of the Aleutian Islands, to the Asian mainland and the northern islands of Japan, and in the Bering Sea. A giant Pacific spiny lumpsucker is five inches long, but most are closer to an inch. Scuba divers are their biggest fans because the little fellows will eat right out of their hands.

Key information for optimal growth:  

- Sea surface temperatures between **12 and 18 degrees Celsius**  
- Net Primary Productivity between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

### Task 1: Load and Visualize data
We'll start with a data file of Marine Protected Areas monitored by the US
Federal government on the west coast: `mpas_westcoast.shp`. This is found in 
your `shapefiles` directory. Load this in using the `st_read` function. 


```{r}

```

### Task 2
Plot a map of these protected areas using `plot`, `ggplot` with the `geom_sf` command, or
`mapview`. Whichever approach you choose, color the protected areas according
to their "State" column.  Keep in mind, spatial data is memory intensive - some
plots make take a little while to load. 

```{r}

```


### Task 3
How much protected marine habitat does each state or agency control?
Which controls the most? Try using the `st_area` command to find out. The `group_by` 
and `summarise` sequence you learned in previous modules may help!

```{r}

```


## Exercise 2: Load and Play with Raster data
**Sea Surface Temperature**

In the `rasters` folder, there are 5 `.tif` files with the naming pattern `average_annual_sst_[year].tif`, which are 5 annual average sea surface temperatures for our region (2008-2012). We want just **one** raster file of the average SST over that time period.

### Task 1: Read in raster data
To create a single average Sea Surface Temperature layer, you'll first need to read in 
all 5 data files (try adapting the `list.files()` function). To read them all in, 
you'll use the `raster` function. This is a good place to try the `map` function too! 

```{r sst}

```

### Task 2: Visualize & Explore

Before running any calculation or analysis, visualize the data. Plot 1 or all of the
rasters, to take a look at them. 
```{r}

```

*Notice the data values are in Kelvin - we will change this to celsius later.*

Try exploring the data, using basic functions like `hist()`, or `summary()`

```{r}

```
#### Question: What year had the highest annual sea surface temperature recorded?

```{r}

```

### Task 4: Stack rasters

To get a single layer of average SST in degrees Celsius we need to first `stack` all layers.

![](images/singletomulti.png)

`stack` is a function from the raster package that puts all RasterLayers into a RasterStack. 
It can stack either from filenames for rasters, or from the raster objects themselves. 
Produce a rasterstack of Average Sea Surface Temperature across all 5 years. Try using the
`plot` function to visualize the stack.

```{r}

```

### Task 5: Raster calcuations

We want to take this stack of 5 rasters and make one. Additionally for easier
interpretation, we want our averaged raster in Celsius. The conversion between Kelvin
and Celsius is: 
$C = K - 273.15$

This collapse and conversion could be done in multiple steps, but since we like
to emphasize concision in our coding, let's instead write a
small custom function to take the mean and convert to Celsius. We will then apply 
this function to our rasterstack to calculate a new raster we can use for analysis. 

Write your custom R function. 

```{r}

```

We can perform operations on a RasterStack by using the `calc()` function from 
the `raster` package. Use the `calc()` function to apply your conversion from 
above and then plot the resulting raster. 

```{r}

```

## Exercise 3: Projections

Since Lumpsuckers may be influenced by more than just sea surface temperature, 
we want to include **Net Primary Production (NPP)** in our analysis. 
So we need to read that in too and create a rasterstack of ur new `sst_avg` raster
and the NPP layer. 

#### Task 1: Read in NPP raster data   

Read in the NPP data, using the `raster()` command and the "annual_npp.tif"
found in the rasters folder. This data is the net primary production (mgC/m2/day).
After reading it in, plot this data. 

```{r}

```

### Task 2:  Reproject

Try adding these two layers together using `stack` and you'll get an error because
these rasters are not in the same "projection" - pretty obvious from the plots.
In order to do analysis across multiple spatial datasources, they must be using the
same coordinate reference system. 

Use the `crs()` command to see what coordinate system each of your rasters are using and, for
good measure, use the `st_crs` command to investigate the crs of our vector data, `west_coast`, from above:
```{r}

```

Looks like `npp` is equal to our `west_coast` but our mean SST layer is different! 
It's crucial when doing spatial 
analysis that your projections across all layers are equal. We can
use `projectRaster()` from the raster package to reproject a RasterLayer from 
one projection to another. You will need to define what the new projection 
should be by setting a coordinate reference system using the argument `crs =`.

Project your average SST layer into npp's coordinate reference system and prove to yourself they 
are equal using the `identicalCRS` function. 

```{r}

```

You will get an error about non-missing arguments here, this is because in order 
to have our two raster layers match in extent, our SST layer covers a lot of 
missing values on its edges which `raster` is encountering
in the projection. We can ignore this error for now, but if you're curious about 
the values of a raster you can always look at them using the `values` command. Try
`summary(values(SST_layer))`  -- how many NAs does our raster have? 

It's important to note that although here we have given you mostly prepared data,
in practice the projection may not be the only thing different across your rasters. 
To do any sort of analysis using multiple rasters, they all need to be in the 
same extent, projection and cell resolution. You can check this with the command
`all.equal()` in the `raster` library*

Okay! now we're ready to get to some analysis. For convenience, stack the now 
matching rasters together using the `stack` function and plot them.

```{r}

```

#### Question: Looking at them side by side, do you have intuition about where lumpsuckers are likely to survive? 
Remember: Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**


## Exercise 4:  Analysis   

Now that our data is prepped and guaranteed to play nicely, we can move onto the
fun stuff - **analyzing the data**. For this specific analysis, we need to use 
the SST and NPP data to find areas along the US West Coast that are suitable for 
growing lumpsucker fish. This requires removal of all cells from NPP and SST 
that are not within the ideal growth parameter range.

Although we could do this from the raster itself reclassifying and subsetting,
those dataset but because in this module we are most interested in the `sf` package, 
let's get back to vector data. 

### Task 1: Sample Points & Extract values from Rasters
Try using the `st_sample()` function, to sample 1000 points from the west coast 
mpa polygons we filtered in task 1. Once sampled, you will have an `sfc` object, 
or a "simple features collection". These collections represent spatial geometry, but 
don't support attribute data. If we want to extract any data to these points we need to convert
them first to a full `sf` object which functions as a dataframe. 
Good news, the `st_sf()` command can do just that! Convert your sampled points and then use
`st_join()` to retrieve the MPAs info (from `west_coast`) for each sampled point. 

```{r}

```

#### R Question: Why does your new dataframe of points likely have fewer than 1000 points? 
See the `st_sample()` documentation and explain. 

### Task 2: Extract Raster Values
Use your sampled points to extract information from the rasters 
on sea surface temperature and net primary productivity, 
try using the `raster::extract` function. Remember `mutate` plays nicely
with `sf` objects. 

```{r}

```

### Task 3: Analysis Questions
For the following questions, remember that Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

#### Question 1: At what percentage of your sampled points would lumpsucker fish be found?
```{r}

```

#### Question 2: In your set of sampled points, what is the minimum latitude where lumpsucker fish are likely to be found?
```{r}

```

#### Question 3: Plot only those points where lumpsucker fish are found. 
```{r}

```
